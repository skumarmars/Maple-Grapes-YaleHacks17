Maple Grapes was our group's submission for Yale Hacks '17.  It is a data-driven solution for predicting emerging technologies. Project was awarded 2nd place for the Informa Data Prediction Challenge.


## Technical

* Problem: Informa’s customers want to understand what new technologies will be most relevant to their businesses.

* Solution: Using a neural network to algorithmically predict the estimated “noise” of a technology. This information is then displayed in a dynamic dashboard for Informa’s market analysts.

* Technologies: Express.JS, NodeJS, Chart.Js, NumPy

* Custom Algorithm:
